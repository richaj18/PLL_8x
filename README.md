<h3> Phase Locked Loop - Theory </h3>

The SOC and other ICs requires the clock signal to perform certain specific functions,<br>
and thus we need to generate the clock signal of a particular frequency without any frequency <br>
or phase noise.<br>
This clock signal can be generated by the two methods: <br>
<b> a. Voltage Controlled Oscillator <b> <br>
       It has good flexibility and on-chip implementation but it has noise in phase <br>
<b> b. Quartz Crystal Oscillator <b> <br>
       It has purity in spectrum which means it does not have any unwanted frequency but it is not flexible like VCO <br>

Thus we need to design a PLL having a pure spectral as well as flexibility.<br>

PLL is a control system which mimics the reference signal having the same frequency <br>
and a constant phase difference between the reference signal and output signal generated. <br>
