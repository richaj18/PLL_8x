The SOC and other ICs requires the clock signal to perform certain specific functions, and thus we need to generate the clock signal of a particular frequency without any frequency or phase noise. This clock signal can be generated by the two methods: a. Voltage Controlled Oscillator b. Quartz Crystal Oscillator Each of these two methods have certain limitations.

Voltage Control Oscillator It has good flexibility and on-chip implementation but it has noise in phase

Quartz Crystal It has purity in spectrum which means it does not have any unwanted frequency but it is not flexible like VCO.

Thus we need to design a PLL having a pure spectral as well as flexibility. PLL is a control system which mimics the reference signal having the same frequency and a constant phase difference between the reference signal and output signal generated.
